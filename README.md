# Hierarchical-model-for-League-of-Ireland-Football-Prediction
This repo features a hierarchical model for predicting League of Ireland outcomes using PyMC. It adapts a 2010 approach to simulate match results based on Italian League scoring data, inferring each team's latent "strength." The model uses Transfermarkt data from 2012-2023, showcasing probabilistic programming for football analytics.
