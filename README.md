# Bayesian-Hierarchical-model-for-League-of-Ireland-Football-Prediction
This repo features a hierarchical model for predicting League of Ireland outcomes using PyMC. It adapts a 2010 approach to simulate match results by Baio and Blangiardo based on Italian League scoring data and Peadar Coyle's approach to Six Nation's Rugby model, inferring each team's latent "strength." The model uses Transfermarkt data from 2012-2023, showcasing probabilistic programming for football analytics.
